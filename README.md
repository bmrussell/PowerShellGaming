# POWERSHELL GAMING UTILITIES

## Play-Game
Temporarily optimise Windows to launch a game and return to previous settings when done. Useful when running games over nVidia or Sunshine streaming at different resolutions.

1. Sets power plan
2. Changes screen resolution (I'm looking at you Starfield ðŸ‘€)
3. Turnms HDR on ([HDR Switch](Needs https://github.com/bradgearon/hdr-switch))
3. Stops useless services (Needs for the user to have the rights. See `Grant-ServiceStopStart.ps1`)
4. Waits for game to finish
5. Returns settings to previous values

### Example
```powershell
pwsh -Command "Play-Game.ps1 -Launch '"C:\Users\brian\OneDrive\Desktop\Starfield.lnk"' -Name 'Starfield' -Plan 'GameTurbo (High Performance)' -Wait 10 -Width 1920 -Height 1080 -HDR -Trace - StopServices"
```
